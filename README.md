# Starcraft_Rank_Prediction
## Description : 
This project involves the analysis of the Starcraft dataset using a Logistic Regression model. The aim is to predict the rank of players based on various features present in the dataset.

The Starcraft dataset contains information about players' gameplay such as Average Actions Per Minute (APM), Action Latency, and Total Hours played.
By analyzing these features and applying the Logistic Regression model, we can gain insights into the factors that contribute to a player's rank.
